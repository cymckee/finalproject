    <h2>About Dating</h2>
    <p>Dating is a stage of romantic relationships practiced in Western societies whereby two people meet socially with the aim of each assessing the other's suitability as a prospective partner in a future intimate relationship. It represents a form of courtship, consisting of social activities carried out by the couple, either alone or with others. The protocols and practices of dating, and the terms used to describe it, vary considerably from society to society and over time. While the term has several meanings, the most frequent usage refers to two people exploring whether they are romantically or sexually compatible by participating in dates with the other. With the use of modern technology, people can date via telephone or computer or arrange to meet in person. Dating means different things to different people, especially across generations. At love is respect, we define dating as two or more people in an intimate relationship. The relationship may be sexual (though it doesn’t have to be), it could be serious or casual, gay or straight, monogamous or open, short-term or long-term.

        We prefer the gender-neutral term “partners” to refer to people in intimate relationships, but you might use a different term for your relationship depending on your situation. No matter how you define it, it’s important to make sure you’re on the same page with your partner in setting the definitions and boundaries of your relationship.</p>
    <h2>Dating Fundamentals for Healthy Relationships</h2> 
    <p>No matter where you are in your relationship—even if it hasn’t begun yet—there are some fundamentals to know about dating that’ll help ensure you and your partner(s) build a healthy relationship. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to dating, and you know your situation best: all our resources are here to empower you to make your own best decision.

        As Teddy Roosevelt said, the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is posted in profile pictures; who strives valiantly for setups; who errs, who comes up short again and again on dates; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions of asking for and getting that second “Yes”; who spends himself in the worthy cause of the first kiss; who at best knows in the end the triumph of the Walk of Shame, and who at worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring to close the deal, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid bachelors who know neither consummation nor cold shower.

OK, so I changed a lot of — and desecrated — one of the greatest speeches in American history, but you get the point. You have to be willing to try. Have questions or concerns about your relationship that aren’t covered here? Our advocates are available 24/7 by text, phone, and live chat to discuss your situation. Remember: relationship abuse can happen to anyone, but no one ever deserves it.</p>

Life is stressful and challenging.These stumbling blocks and the stress that comes with them will begin to erode your good communication skills.

    <h3>Romance</h3>
    <p>Romantic love is based upon mutual attraction and affection between two people that connect them as a couple. Romantic love is the main foundation of appeal between two people. Love is the main element in any intimate relationship as it represents the foundation on which the entire relationship is built. Romantic love is an intense adulation of a love relationship, in which an emotional connection between two people overrides all external and material considerations. It is common that the emotions and feelings of romantic love are closely linked with sexual attraction, romantic feelings can exist without the presence of any kind of sexual consummation.</p>

     <h3>Happiness</h3>
    <p>Both individuals most be committed to their own personal happiness. Happiness within a relationship is hard to define.... For some, happiness involves a tremendous amount of fun, great intimacy or lots of laughter. Whatever your definition, it directly correlates to your expectations, desires, wants and needs—and those things can change over time.
        Happy couples are more present with each other and make an effort to listen and take each other's needs seriously. They make an effort to validate each other—communicating that a partner's perspective is understandable and valid, given their personal history or current circumstances.</p>
