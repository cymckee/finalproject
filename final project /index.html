    <h2>Introduction</h2>   
    <p>Love is respect is the national resource to disrupt and prevent unhealthy relationships and intimate partner violence by empowering young people through inclusive and equitable education, support, and resources.Love is more than just the way you feel. Every successful relationship is built on a foundation of respect. Respect means caring about your partner’s wants and needs and always taking them into account before speaking or acting. The expectation is that your partner will follow the same guidelines. My official definition is as follows: Respect means putting the comfort, well-being and happiness of the person you’re with at an equal level to your own. Please enjoy the video below.</p>

     <h3>Happiness</h3>
    <p>Both individuals most be committed to their own personal happiness. Happiness within a relationship is hard to define.... For some, happiness involves a tremendous amount of fun, great intimacy or lots of laughter. Whatever your definition, it directly correlates to your expectations, desires, wants and needs—and those things can change over time.
      Happy couples are more present with each other and make an effort to listen and take each other's needs seriously. They make an effort to validate each other—communicating that a partner's perspective is understandable and valid, given their personal history or current circumstances.</p>
