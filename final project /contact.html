     <p>In relationships, communication allows to you explain to someone else what you are experiencing and what your needs are. The act of communicating not only helps to meet your needs, but it also helps you to be connected in your relationship.What happens to couples who say they struggle with communication is – life. Life is stressful and challenging.These stumbling blocks and the stress that comes with them will begin to erode your good communication skills.

    <h3>Romance</h3>
    <p>Romantic love is based upon mutual attraction and affection between two people that connect them as a couple. Romantic love is the main foundation of appeal between two people. Love is the main element in any intimate relationship as it represents the foundation on which the entire relationship is built. Romantic love is an intense adulation of a love relationship, in which an emotional connection between two people overrides all external and material considerations. It is common that the emotions and feelings of romantic love are closely linked with sexual attraction, romantic feelings can exist without the presence of any kind of sexual consummation.</p>

     <h3>Happiness</h3>
    <p>Both individuals most be committed to their own personal happiness. Happiness within a relationship is hard to define.... For some, happiness involves a tremendous amount of fun, great intimacy or lots of laughter. Whatever your definition, it directly correlates to your expectations, desires, wants and needs—and those things can change over time.
        Happy couples are more present with each other and make an effort to listen and take each other's needs seriously. They make an effort to validate each other—communicating that a partner's perspective is understandable and valid, given their personal history or current circumstances.</p>
