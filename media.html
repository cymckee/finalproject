  <h2>Personal Safety</h2>
</ul>  
  <p>We all deserve safe, healthy relationships.A safety plan is a personalized, practical plan to improve your safety while experiencing abuse, preparing to leave an abusive situation, or after you leave. This plan includes vital information tailored to your unique situation and will help you prepare for and respond to different scenarios, including telling your friends and family about your situation, coping with emotions, and various resources suited to your individual circumstances.

    Some of the preparations for a safety plan might seem obviously, but it can be hard to think clearly or make logical decisions during moments of crisis. Having a safety plan laid out in advance can help you protect yourself and others in high-stress situations.</p>

<li>Build Your Path To Safety </li>
<p>Safety planning is a set of actions that can help lower your risk of being hurt by your partner. It includes information specific to you and your life that will increase your safety at school, home, and other places that you go on a daily basis.

</p>
<li>Safety at Home</li>
<p>Home is an important sanctuary for anyone, whether you’re in a relationship, single, or not even looking. It’s a space to make your own where you feel free to express yourself, comfortable decompressing, and most of all, safe and in control.
<li>Safety at School</li>
<p>

While you’re likely going to school for a formal education, it’s no secret that a lot more happens there than just classroom learning. Being at school provides you with an opportunity to engage with others with greater independence than you may have at home and a chance to explore new relationships and interests.</p>

       <h3>Happiness</h3>
      <p>Both individuals most be committed to their own personal happiness. Happiness within a relationship is hard to define.... For some, happiness involves a tremendous amount of fun, great intimacy or lots of laughter. Whatever your definition, it directly correlates to your expectations, desires, wants and needs—and those things can change over time.
        Happy couples are more present with each other and make an effort to listen and take each other's needs seriously. They make an effort to validate each other—communicating that a partner's perspective is understandable and valid, given their personal history or current circumstances.</p>
