      <h2>Supporting Others</h2>
      <p>It’s not always clear how best to respond when you witness a friend or roommate experiencing abuse. Depending on the circumstances, your proximity to the survivor (and by extension the person abusing them) may put you in the middle of some tense situations. These are the moments when your friends, roommates, coworkers, or other peers or acquaintances will need your support most, and it’s important to understand what to look for and different ways to respond.
         If you have questions about support strategies to help a friend or roommate (or just need someone to bounce ideas off of), contact one of our advocates 24/7 by text, phone, or live chat.</p>

      <h3>Romance</h3>
      <p>Romantic love is based upon mutual attraction and affection between two people that connect them as a couple. Romantic love is the main foundation of appeal between two people. Love is the main element in any intimate relationship as it represents the foundation on which the entire relationship is built. Romantic love is an intense adulation of a love relationship, in which an emotional connection between two people overrides all external and material considerations. It is common that the emotions and feelings of romantic love are closely linked with sexual attraction, romantic feelings can exist without the presence of any kind of sexual consummation.</p>

       <h3>Happiness</h3>
      <p>Both individuals most be committed to their own personal happiness. Happiness within a relationship is hard to define.... For some, happiness involves a tremendous amount of fun, great intimacy or lots of laughter. Whatever your definition, it directly correlates to your expectations, desires, wants and needs—and those things can change over time.
        Happy couples are more present with each other and make an effort to listen and take each other's needs seriously. They make an effort to validate each other—communicating that a partner's perspective is understandable and valid, given their personal history or current circumstances.</p>
